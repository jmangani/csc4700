Devastated - Joey Bada$$

I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it
But now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I-I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah
But now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience

Okay, just getting better each day
Stacking that cheddar, cheese cake
Looking up to the Lord, we pray
Trying to be my best each day
Until I'm laid to rest we lay, yeah
'Til the time being we lit
Hoping I don't let it get all in my head
I don't need money just to say that I'm rich
Couple little honeys wanna get in my bed
But they used to run from me when I had nothing
Now they want to fuck 'cause they see me stuntin'
Nigga came up off the hustling
Living in a life of lux and I'm feeling like the man
If you ain't in my Chucks, then you wouldn't understand homie
'Bout these rubber bands on me
Make her wanna dance for me
Probably leave her man for me
Standing in the stairs Goddamn
(She used to front way back, now she just a fan)

I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah
Now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I-I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it yeah
But now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience

I put my pain in a cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowing the ceiling
So just go with the feeling
Baby soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes

I put my pain in a cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowing the ceiling
So just go with the feeling
Baby soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Skr, skr

I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah
Now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I-I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah
But now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience

At times I thought we'd (we'd never make it)
But now we on our way 
And all that ever took was patience
